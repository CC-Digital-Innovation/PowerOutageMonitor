[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/) 

These python scripts use a series of API requests to check if a given address (USA) has an ongoing power outage or not. The data is parsed from a CSV or a JSON file. The script currently uses two open REST APIs, PGE and GIS to check for outage status.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python
    * _Note: Developed using Python 3.8.7 64-bit, but was not tested with any other version._

### Installation

1. Download code from GitHub

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/PowerOutageMonitor.git
    ```

    * or download the zip: https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/PowerOutageMonitor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

2. Create virtual environment

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv example-env
    ```

3. Activate virtual environment

    ```bash
    source example-env/bin/activate
    ```

    On Windows:
    ```powershell
    example-env\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
4. Install required modules

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

* The configuration file ([config.yaml](https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/PowerOutageMonitor/blob/main/config.yaml)) can run as is. Make adjustments to the file as necessary.
* The data files, site.csv and site.json must be changed to have real address and names for real-world application.
* For customization, only need to edit the check_site.py file main() function. The default implementation shows different API calls and data parsing methods.
* To run the script on a terminal to make appropriate changes, navigate to the directory and run the following command: -  
   ``` bash
   python3 check_site.py
    ```
